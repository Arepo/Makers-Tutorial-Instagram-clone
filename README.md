============

This was the final Makers tutorial project, using Rails, Bootstrap, Devise, Omniauth, Amazon Web Services, Paperclip, Stripe, Launchy, Capybara, theoretically GMaps (not implemented yet and probably not any time soon, since we used it for our [final project](https://github.com/Arepo/WorkMap)), and a few other bits and pieces. 

Like the other tutorials, the code mostly comes from the coaches (with any errors mine), so I'm keeping it up here mainly for  reference, ie when I want to refresh myself on how to use the above technologies. To see it running, just run 'rails s' from the main directory.
